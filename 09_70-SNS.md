# Simple Notification Service
* Web service - setup, operates and send messages from an application to another. it works in the publish/subscriber model.

* it works with push notifications, so no need for POLLS anymore. 

* this is the basic difference between the SQS and SNS, the design ideia is whenever you need pull or push requests from your applications.

* it can even send notifications to mobiles, in the way apps works. It can even send notifications via SMS and email. to any http/https endpoint, and as said before, to SQS. it also supports email in json format.

* To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored redundantly accross multiple AZ.

* Format is JSON only.

* each subscription needs to be confirmed in order to be added (in 3 days).

## Topics

SNS allows you to group multiple recipients using topics. A topic is an "access point" for allowing multiple recipients to dynamically subscribe for identical copies of the same notification.

One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint type: for example, you can group together iOS, Android and SMS recipients. When you publish once to a topic, SNS delivers appropriately formatted copies of your messages to each subscriber.

* Same as subject.
