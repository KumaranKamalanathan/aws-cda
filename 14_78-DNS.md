# DNS
* Domain name, service - converts a address to IP (ipv4 or ipv6)
* VPCs are IPv6 compatible.

# Registrar 
* Authorities to register DNS, with InterNIC. 

# SOA records
Things that are inside the records:
* the name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
* administrator of the zone (email, name)
* versioning
* the time a secondary sever should wait before next update
* same thing but for re-requesting a failed transfer.
* TTL of a secondary server can use the data.


# NS Records
NS are Name Server, and are used by top level domain servers to direct traffic to the content DNS server which contains the authorities DNS records.
Basically, when you create a a domain with route 53, you'll get a bunch of records and you go to your host provider (godaddy) and register your domain with these records.

UPDATE: AWS now can be a dns register! don't need godaddy.

type:
"A" - Address - translate the name of domain to ip address. 

Remember that ELB do not have a ip adress, they only have the DNS name.	So A records can not be used for them!

TTL - time the DNS is cached, your pc or resolver service. Default is 2 days. Bare in mind that if you plan to migrate your DNS, you might have 2 routes for it active.

CNAME - resolve one domain to another. for example, www.mysite.brauner to douglas.brauner.site.com

ALIAS records - alias records are used to map resources record sets in your hosted zone to to ELB, CF distributions, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites. They work like CNAME, in which you can map a domain url to a resource (elb1234.elb.amazonaws.com)

Difference is that you can't have a CNAME for a naked domain name (zone apex record). You can't have cname for acloud.guru, it must be either an A record or an Alias. Named domain name is the domain without the www.


# Alias in Route53
* it automatically recognizes changes in the records set that the alias resource records set refers to.

if I have a site pointing to an ELB, and the IP of that ELB changes, amazon route53 will detect that and reflects that changes to the DNS without changes to the hosted zone that contains resource records set for the site.

# Exam tips
* ELBs do not have a predefined Ip address, you resolve to them using DNS name.
* Alias allows you to resolve naked domain names to zone apex records. CNAME is for routing domains purely.
* If you use CNAME, you will be charged by request. If you use Alias records is free!
* Always choose Alias.
