# Flow LOGS

A feature that enables yoou to capture information about the ip traffic going throught the network interfaces in the VPC. Flow logs are stored in Amazon CloudWatch logs. 

Can be created in 3 levels:

* VPC
* Subnet
* Network interface level


you create it in the options when selecting the VPC.

Filter by accepted, rejected or all.

You need to create a row to allow Flows to log to cloudwatch..

You need to create a log group in cloudwatch. 

As logs are going throught the cloudwatch, you can do some nasty things with it!

1. Stream to Lambda - you can work and have scripts and functions based on the logs information
2. Stream to AWS Elasticsearch Service - like kibana.

You can export them to S3.

# Exam tips

* You can not enable flow logs to VPC that are in peer with your VPC, unless they are in your account.

* You can not tag a flow log
* You can not change configurations of that flow log after its creation, like changing the role associated.


Not all IP traffic is monitored!
* Traffic generated by instances when they contact Amazon DNS service, unless you are using your own DNS service.
* Traffic generated by Windows instances for Windows - e.g. Windows licensing auditing
* Traffic of metadata - 169.254.169.254
* DHCP traffic
* Traffic to the reserved IP addreses (e.g. default VPC router)
