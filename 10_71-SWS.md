# Simple Workflow Service

* Amazon Simple Workflow Service (or Amazon SWF) is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work accross distributed application components. SWF enables applications for a range of use cases, including media processing, web application backends, business process workflows, and analytics pipelines to be designed as a coordination of tasks.

* Tasks represent invocation of varios processing steps in an application which can be performed by executable code, web service calls, human actions and scripts.

* For a workflow, you will need a worker and a decider. 


## SWF Workers

* Workers are programs that interact with SWF to get tasks, process received tasks and return the results.

## SQF Decider
* The decider is a program that controls the coordination of tasks, i.e. the ordering, concurrency, and scheduling according to the application logic. 

## SWF W & D

They can run on cloud infrastructure, such as EC2 or on machines behind firewalls. Amazon SWF brokers the interactions between workers and the decider. It allows the decider to get consistent views into the progress of tasks and to initiate  new tasks in an ongoing manner. At the same time, SWF store tasks, assign them to workers when they are ready, and monitors their progress. It ensures that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. Since amazon SWF maintains the application state durably, workers and deciders don't have to keep track of execution state. They can run independently, and scale quickly.

So, the main difference between this and SQS is that a task is assigned only once and is never duplicated!

## SWF Domains

* Your workflow and activity types and the workflow execution itself are all scoped to a domain. Domains isolate a set of types, executions, and task lists from others within the same account. You can register a domain by using the AWS Management Console or by using the *RegisterDomain* action in the Amazon SWF API.

* Think Domain as a container.

Example:
https://swf.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
RegisterDomain
{
	"name" : "2313123",
	"description" : "description",
	"workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays" : "30"
}

## Tips
Maximum Workflow can be 1 year. and the value is always measured in seconds. (way more than SQS)

## SQS vs SWF

* SWF presents a task-oriented API, whereas SQS offers messages-oriented API.
* SWF ensures that a task is executed only once and is never duplicated. in SQS you need to handle duplicated messages and may also need to ensure that a message is processed only once.

* SWF keeps track of all the tasks and events in an application. in SQS you need to implement your own application-level tracking, especiallly if your application uses multiple queues.

* in tricky questions, you might consider if there is any human interaction and in times of delivery timeframes.

Some hints of languages also can be useful, like workers, deciders, domains, etc.
