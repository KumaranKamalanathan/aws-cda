# Elastic compute cloud
It provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
Reduce time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes. 

## On Demand - pay by hour - now you can buy by second.

## Reserved - 1 year or 3 years - gets discount.

##Spot - bid price for instance capacities.
big data processing - when prices are low - need flexible start and end times.
If you terminate the instance - you pay for the whole hour, but if aws stop the instance because the threshold was hit, then you get the whole hour for free.

##Dedicated Host


## Instance Types
- *D* density
- R for RAM
- M - main choice for general purpose applications
- C - Compute
- G - Graphics
- I - IOPS
- F - FPGA - change physical hardware underneat - hardware acceleration
- T - low cost - (free ones)
- P - Machine learning - General purpose graphics
- X - eXtreme memory - HANA


# EBS
EBS are like discs that you attach to your ec2 instances. You can create volumes on top of those discs. 
You can create a database. They are automatically replicated to protect. failure of a single component.

## EBS volume types
- General purpose SSD (GP2) < 10.000 IOPS
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
	designed for io intense, Nosql > 10.000 iops < 20.000 IOPS
- Throuput optimized HDD (ST1)
	Big data, data warehouse, log processing. - sequential writes.
	cannot be a boot volume.
- Cool HDD (SC1)
	Low cost storage for infrequent access. 
- Magnetic (Standard)
	Lowest cost you will found. 

One EBS can be attached to only one EC2, it like a physical drive attached. For multiple assignement, use EFS.

# Exam tips
- differneces in price models
- in spot - if you terminate you pay for the hour

# Launching Instances
- When configuring a subnet, remember that one subnet points to an AZ, so no crosses are allowed.

# Migration of EC2 instances
First you need to create a snapshot of that instance, then you can create a AMI image and that image you can replicate to another availability zone or country.
