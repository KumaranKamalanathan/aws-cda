# Load Balancer
There are 3 types of load balancer:
* Application - https and http
* Network load balancer - TCP
* Classic - custom for any use. Old EC2 instances

When you create a LB, you can assign the VPC and select the subnets. the subnets must be public and across multiple AZ. If not you'll get an warning that it wouldn't work. You can use an internet gateway for the private subnets.

At least 2 subnet must be selects in 2 AZ.
