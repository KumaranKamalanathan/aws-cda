# Problem

The problem for 1 code in a s3 bucket, like javascript, to be able to reference a code in another s3 bucket.

CORS - cross origin resource sharing. 

when enabling the CORS for a S3 bucket, remember to always use the website url, not the absolute s3 path for the file. This can be tricky, but the resource acessing a remote file is actualy a webserver (even if it is serverless), thats why you need the website url.
You don't need to upload a cors.xml file, you can configure it directly for the bucket in properties, then you set the permissions for remote acessing.
