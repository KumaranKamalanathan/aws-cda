# ACL

Network ACL - Access control list -
A single subnet can be only associated to one ACL, not multiple!

When you create a ACL you must associate it to a VPC (no spam vpc)

when you create a private network access control list, everything is denied by default (inbound and outbound)

Amazon recommend you to create each rule based on a multiple of 100, so first one is 100 and second 200.

101 ipv6 and 201 and so on.

ACL are stateless - so you provision for each individually, inbound and outbound. security groups works for both ways automatically, it is stateful.

Ephemeral port - temporary port in a range that aws will use to send data back to the client. you can define the range to use. 

If you select a subnet for association in the ACL, it will loose the bind with any other acl because you can have only one for a given subnet.

# Evaluation
Rules are evaluated following its numeric order, so if I have a rule that allows all traffic in rule 100 and a rule that denies the traffic in rule 200, the first rule will be predominant, it will allow the traffic, the contrary would happen if the rules were in the reversal order.

you can block specific ip addresses, or ranges.

security groups comes after the ACL, so if my security groups are allowing traffic throught the port 80 and the ACL not, the security group would never get the access.


# Exam tips
You VPC automatically comes with a default network ACL and it has all network for inbound and outbound by default.

Each subnet must be associated to an network ACL, if you don't do so, the subnet will be associated to the default ACL.

Security groups can not block specific addresses.

ephemeral ports works only with outbound.
