# Amazon Simple Queue Service

* SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for compute capacity to process them.

* SQS is a distributed queue system that enables a web service application to quicly and reliably queue messages that one component in the application generates to be consumed by another component. A queue is a temporary repository for messages that are awaiting processing. 

* By using SQS you can decouple the components of an application, so can run independently. Any components in the application can store messages in a fail safe queue.

* Messages can contain up to 256kb of text in any format. Any component can later retrieve the messages programatically using the SQS API.

* The queue acts as a buffer between the components producing and saving the data, and the component receiving the data for processsing.

* This means that the queue resolves issues that arise if the producer is producing work faster than the consumer can process it. or if the producer or consumer are intermitently connected to network (up).

* Amazon SQS ensures deliver of each message at least once. and supports multiple readers and writers interacting with the same queue.

* A single queue can be used simultaneosly by many distributed application components, with no need for those components to coordinate with each other to share the queue.

* SQS is engineered to always be available and deliver messages. One of the resulting tradeoff is that SQS does not guarantess first in, first out delivery of messages. For many distributed application, each message can stand on its own, and as long as all messages are delivered, the order is not important.

* If your system required that order be preserved, you can place sequencing information on each message, so that you can reoder the messages when the queue returns them.

** UPDATE: it now supports FIFO, if you end your queue with .fifo in some regions it will have support. But bare in mind that its performance is reduced to 300 operations per second. and it deliver exactly-one.

* To illustrate, suppose you have a number of images files to encode. In SQS worker queue, you create SQS messages for each file specifying the command (jped-encode) and the location of the file in Amazon S3. A pool of amazon EC2 instances running the needed image processing software does the following:
 * Asynchronously pull the task messages from the queue;
 * Retrieves the named file;
 * Processes the conversion;
 * Writes the image back to s3;
 * Writes a 'task completed' to another queue;
 * deletes the original task message;

* When you put a message to the queue, it will have a Visibility Timeout clock, which will only starting counting down when someone picks the message from the queue, that's how AWS SQS defines the 'deliver at least once' for messages.

If for some reason the worker fails to process, the timeout will occur. Another application can poll the queue and see that the visibility of the message has expired and start the reprocessing of that message.

So, only when the message is deleted from the queue that the task is finished.

You can setup autoscale for SQS, it will for example start more processing server to consume data from SQS.

## Exam Tips
* 12h visibility timeout by default
* You should carry on that SQS delivers at least once, so you need to design your system in order that processing a message more than once does not create any inconsistency.

* the billing may still be in 64kb chunk format.

## Pricing
* First one million SQS requests per month are free.
* 50 cents per million per month. 
* single request can batch up to 10 message, but the maximum still in 256
* each 64kb chunk of payload is charged as one request. if you make an APi call with 256kb payload, you will be billed with 4 requests.

* DECOUPLE is the work, in the exam if the word appear, if you need to decouple the application, SQS is the key service that will allow your components to scale independently and reliably.
